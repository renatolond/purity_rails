t = Test.create(name: '1500 Point Purity Test', description: '## THE UNISEX PURITY TEST
## VERSION 6.6b - 1500 QUESTIONS

This is the 1500 point Purity Test!

We felt that the 1000 point version lost a lot of the "fun" of the earlier versions, so we re-wrote it, adding a few new sections, and a shitload of questions. This test is guaranteed to be nosier than your parents, more invasive than the census, and containing something to offend everybody.

Enjoy (and I know you will).

### Instructions for Use:

This is a fairly long test consisting of 1500 questions. It starts out tame and gets progressively worse (or better, depending on your viewpoint). There are many ways of going about taking this test. You can, of course, as your right, guaranteed by the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in your room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the most fun way to utilize this test is to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one copy of the test, and a bunch of friends. (Lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.) The person with the copy of the test is the test administrator; s/he reads the questions out loud and everybody else writes down their answers. We have no definite rules as to whether the participants are required to divulge their answers; that is up to the group to decide. However, being open with your answers leads to some great conversations. But no matter what you decide, each person\'s purity score should be made common knowledge. (The person with the highest score gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.) This works great at parties and lets everybody know who\'s easy and who isn\'t, so you\'ll know who to go home with. Don\'t leave home without it.

On the whole, this is biased for experience and, hence, age. If you\'re still too young to qualify, well, these things take time. Chaste makes waste. Virginity can be cured. Remember: the conjugation is "I am erotic, You are kinky, They are perverts"

All questions in this test pertain to events that have happened to you subsequent to your weaning and babyhood/infancy. Anything that may have happened before that time is considered not standing and void.

### Definitions: (for the innocent, naive, or too busy)

* **Necking**: the kissing or stroking of a persons head or neck, the stroking of arms hands or back.
* **Petting**: the above plus the caressing or fondling of other portions of anatomy; through or underneath clothing.
* **Sexual activity**: all of the above, plus what your puerile imagination dreams up. Doesn\'t necessarily mean penetration (but it can).
* **Posslq**: "person of the opposite sex sharing living quarters." Bureaucrat for live-in lover.
* **Masturbation**: the rubbing/feeling of your genitals. Doesn\'t need to be to orgasm. Can be through clothing.
* **Mutual Masturbation**: You masturbating your partner and/or you being masturbated. Not necessarily both at the same time.

We would now like to bring to your attention that there is no passing nor failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn\'t worry too much about getting a high score...even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

**_ALL TECHNICALITIES COUNT_**

And, most of all, this is entertainment. Have as much fun in the taking as was had in the making.')
